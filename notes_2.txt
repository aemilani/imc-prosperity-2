Orchides:
- Sunlight < 7 hours/day --> production decreases with 4% for every 10 minutes
- Ideal humidity: Betwene 60% and 80%. Outside these limits, production falls with 2% for every 5%
  point of humidity change
- Shipping costs and import and export tariffs
- Storage space for Orchids (max 5000?). Costs 0.1 SS per Orchid per timestamp (only for long positions)
- Position limit: 100

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Production will have an effect of the definiton of a fair value for Orchids
- Storage cost will only be a cost deducted for net long positions with no premimum from shorts.
- Each day in ORCHIDs trading is equivalent to 12 hours on the island. You can assume the ORCHID
  quality doesn't deteriorate overnight

- if you want to purchase 1 unit of ORCHID from the south, you will purchase at the askPrice,
  pay the TRANSPORT_FEES, IMPORT_TARIFF
- if you want to sell 1 unit of ORCHID to the south, you will sell at the bidPrice,
  pay the TRANSPORT_FEES, EXPORT_TARIFF

- Average sunlight per hour is 2500 units. The data/plot shows the instantaneous rate of sunlight
  on any moment of the day.
- I think I am starting to understand it. The conversions are like a dark pool where you can
 liqudize your position asap with the cost of several fees. At the same time, the orderdepth
 provide you a market order book where you can trade without fees. What's more important is that
 the trend of order book is highly sensitive to humanity, sunlight and fees. The arbitrage opportunity
 lies in there. Correct me if I am wrong ?
