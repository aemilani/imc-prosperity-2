Gift basket:
- 6 Strawberries
- 4 Chocolates
- 1 Rose

Treasure hunt:

- You share the spoils with everyone that marks the same spot.
- Every spot has its treasure multiplier (up to 100) and the number of hunters (up to 8).
- The spot's total treasure is the product of the base treasure (7500, same for all spots)
  and the spot's specific treasure multiplier.
- The resulting amount is then divided by the sum of the hunters and the percentage of all
  the expeditions (from other players) that took place there.
- For example, if a field has 5 hunters, and 10% of all the expeditions (from all the other players)
  are also going there, the prize you get from that field will be divided by 15.
- After the division, expedition costs apply (if there are any), and profit is what remains.
- Max 3 expeditions
- First expedition is free
- Fee for embarking upon a second expedition is 25000, and for third it's 75000.
- Second and third expeditions are optional: you are not required to do all 3.
- Order of submitted expeditions does not matter for grading.
